# UnityGame
This game was created for the ITEC Contest, Timisoara, game development section.

The theme of the game was "global warming", so it has different levels, each with an increased difficulty and it deals with the idea of glaciers and sea ice melting due to the climate change.

Tools: Unity, Visual Studio, C#
